# Ants

The general objective of this work is to propose the development of a web portal, called ANTS, that meets the needs of the philanthropic entities to disseminate their work and to provide alternative methods of collaboration on the part of the population that is not voluntary.

## Motivation

The interaction between people and services has changed with the large-scale introduction of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The idea came from an application that connects volunteers and philanthropic institutions with the use of geolocation. The Ants is particularly important considering that 25% of the Brazilian population is served by philanthropic institutions.

## Ants Opportunity Service

The part of the project which handles the application opportunities data and manipulation.
